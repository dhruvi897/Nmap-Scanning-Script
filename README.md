# Nmap-Scanning-Script
This is a simple python script which scans the user given IP Address and outputs a csv file with information about the machine obtained by scanning through nmap. The information is enough to search for vulnerabilitles present and perform exploits on the machine.

The machine on which the script is run should contain nmap.
